/**
 * Shared group awareness for a band of AI (PLAN.md Part E / E3). A squad is a node — placed in the
 * editor (members point an {@code @Export squadPath} at it) or created per {@code SpawnConfig} by
 * {@link com.openworld.world.WorldZoneManager}. Members {@link #register} on spawn and
 * {@link #unregister} on free.
 *
 * <p><b>What it buys:</b> when one member confirms a target (LoS in {@code AttackState}, or being shot),
 * it {@link #broadcastSpotted}s — every squad-mate within {@link #alertBroadcastRadius} adopts that
 * target <i>immediately</i>, skipping its own ~0.4 s scan interval. So shooting one AI turns the whole
 * nearby squad toward the shooter within a frame instead of each waking on its next scan.
 * {@code AICharacter.discoverTarget()} consults {@link #getSharedTarget()} before its own scan, so a
 * mate keeps converging even before it personally sees the threat.
 *
 * <p>Squad members are one faction and the spotter already verified the target is hostile, so adopters
 * skip a redundant faction re-check. {@link #getSharedTarget()} self-clears a dead/freed target (the
 * "lose track" path), so explicit {@link #clearThreat()} is only needed to drop a still-alive one.
