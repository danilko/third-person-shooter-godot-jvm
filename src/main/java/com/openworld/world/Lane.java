 * Blender-generated intersection connect automatically wherever their endpoints coincide, no
 * explicit wiring needed.

 * <p>Exactly the surface {@code LaneGraph}/{@code VehicleAIController} already called on
 * {@code VehicleRoute} before this interface existed — see those two classes for how each method
