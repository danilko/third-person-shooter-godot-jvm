/**
 * Data for one streamed open-world zone (PLAN.md Part E / E1) — a placeholder AABB zone:
 * a bounding box plus the AI population to stream in around it. Authored as a {@code .tres}
 * and assigned to a {@link WorldZoneMarker} placed in the level; the marker's world position is
 * the zone <b>center</b>, so designers position a zone by dragging its marker.
 *
 * <p>Geometry is optional — placeholder zones leave {@link #geometry} null and only stream AI;
 * a real zone (once Blender content exists, per BLENDER_CONVENTIONS) sets a geometry scene that
 * is instanced locally on every peer when the zone loads.
 *
 * <p>Load/unload uses hysteresis ({@code unloadRadius} > {@code loadRadius}) so a player lingering
 * at the boundary does not flicker the zone in and out.
