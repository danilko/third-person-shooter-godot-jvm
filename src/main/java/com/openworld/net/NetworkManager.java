/**
 * Peer-lifecycle + replication transport — registered as an AutoLoad singleton named
 * "NetworkManager".
 *
 * AutoLoad entry (add to project.godot after running ./gradlew build):
 *   [autoload]
 *   NetworkManager="*res://gdj/com/game/NetworkManager.gdj"
 *
 * Owns a raw {@link ENetConnection}/{@link ENetPacketPeer} transport directly —
 * deliberately bypassing {@code MultiplayerAPI}/{@code SceneMultiplayer} (and thus
 * {@code rpc()}/{@code MultiplayerSynchronizer}) so this class has full control over
 * framing, validation, rate-limiting, and channel assignment (see NETWORK_REWRITE_PLAN.md).
 * Every system built on top of it must check {@link #isNetworked()} before touching the
 * network — single-player keeps working with no connection at all.
 *
 * Replication model (ownership-based authority): every entity has ONE owner
 * ({@code CharacterInfo.ownerPeerId}) that simulates it locally. Owning clients report
 * their body's state upstream as {@code MSG_SNAPSHOT} ({@link #sendOwnedState}); the host
 * applies it to a {@code NetworkController} puppet and re-broadcasts everything it knows as
 * {@code MSG_SNAPSHOT_BATCH} (~30 Hz both directions, {@link #REPLICATION_INTERVAL_MS}).
 * The host stays authoritative for health/damage ({@code MSG_DAMAGE_REQUEST}), bullet
 * resolution ({@code MSG_SHOT}), spawning ({@code MSG_SPAWN}/{@code MSG_DESPAWN}), world
 * events ({@code MSG_WORLD_EVENT}), and ownership migration ({@code MSG_OWNERSHIP}).
