 *
 * isAuthority() returns false, so Character._physicsProcess skips gatherInput/applyInput/
 * physics entirely (see the early return there) — this body's transform/combat/stance/
 * health/weapon are driven *only* by MSG_SNAPSHOT, replacing what MultiplayerSynchronizer
 * used to do automatically.
 *
 * Position/facing use **near-time snapshot smoothing** (see {@link SnapshotInterpolator}):
 * the latest snapshot is dead-reckoned forward by local frame delta and the rendered
 * transform eases toward that projection — no render clock to fall behind, ~0 steady-state
 * lag. Combat/stance/health/weapon-slot are discrete — applied once on receipt, not
 * interpolated, the same way applyInput only calls setCombatState()/setStance() on change.
