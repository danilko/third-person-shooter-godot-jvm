   * True only for the single body this machine's human is actually playing —

   * processes them, regardless of which body's camera is active — without this
   * gate, a listen-server host with a connected client ends up with two
   * PlayerCameraControllers (its own + the client's ServerProxyController-driven
   * proxy) both consuming the host's mouse, so the proxy body's mesh silently
   * tracks wherever the *host* is looking instead of the remote client's actual
   * aim — exactly the "wrong direction" replication symptom (round 5c report).
