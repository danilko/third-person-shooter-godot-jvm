"""Operators -- the authoring gestures of ROAD_POINT_GRAPH.md 4.1.

Every operator in here is a thin shell: it edits the AUTHORED Empties and their `rka_pt` data and
then stops. It never builds geometry, never computes a lateral offset, and never touches
`ROAD_MANAGER_GEN`. That separation is what makes step 2 testable at all -- the whole scene below
is buildable, and gate-checkable, before a single Geometry Nodes socket exists.

Headless discipline, paid for once already: `--background` NEVER calls an operator's `invoke()`,
and `INVOKE_DEFAULT` degrades silently to `EXEC_DEFAULT` with property defaults. So no operator in
this file may compute anything essential in `invoke()`; everything an operator needs is an operator
PROPERTY, and the panel is what fills those in interactively.

    THE FIX FOR "I EXTENDED INTO THE WRONG ROAD". A road's chain is its object-name order, so a
    stretch that is not joined to the rest of the collection still sorts into the middle of it:
    the build splits it out as a separate run (`point_solve.road_runs`) and gets the geometry
    right, but the gate has to report the seam and every panel reads one road where there are two.
    That is exactly what happens when a ramp is grown with `Extend Road` off its mainline instead
    of `New Road` -- the usual way, because it is the gesture already under your hand.

    Links are OBJECT POINTERS, so nothing has to be rewired: the AUX link from the mainline into
    the moved points survives the move, which is the whole reason a ramp may live in its own road
    in the first place. Both collections are renumbered, so both chains stay in name order."""

    """Drop links that cannot be honoured, restore the halves that went missing

    THE GATE HAS BEEN ADVISING THIS SINCE STEP 1 AND IT DID NOT EXIST. `uid_duplicate` said "run
    Repair Links" and `link_dangling`'s comment called it "an actionable fix rather than advice";
    it was deferred out of step 2 and never came back. So the one class of defect an artist
    genuinely CANNOT see -- a link row pointing at a deleted object, a half-written junction, a
    clone carrying somebody else's uid -- was reported with a remedy nobody could run.

    What it does is exactly the set of repairs that have ONE right answer:

    * **Drop** a row that is structurally impossible: a `None` target (the object was deleted), a
      self-link, a target that is not a point or lives in no road, and a duplicate row to a target
      already linked. A pair of points carries at most ONE link -- `link_objects`' invariant.
    * **Drop** the ramp's half of an `AUX` pair. `AUX` is directed and a ramp point connects ONLY
      to the aux slot (`aux_backlink`).
    * **Restore** the missing half of a `SEGMENT` or `JUNCTION` link, and complete a junction
      component into the full clique. These are "the gesture half-wrote it" cases, and completing
      them is what the gesture would have done.
    * **Write back** a repaired uid. `read_network` already re-allocates one for a Shift+D clone
      (`dedupe_uids`), but nothing persisted it, so every read re-did the same repair and the
      warning never went away.

    Where two rows of one pair DISAGREE about the type, the more explicit gesture wins:
    `AUX` over `JUNCTION` over `SEGMENT`. A junction and a ramp are both things you went and did;
    `SEGMENT` is what `Extend Road` writes by default."""

    `(stations, metres)`.

    A ONE-CLICK GESTURE MUST NOT LEAVE THE GATE RED (8j). Writing `aux_fwd = 1` on the mouth alone
    is the whole aux slot as far as the data model is concerned, and it is wrong on the ground:
    the slot then appears out of nothing over whatever gap happens to precede the mouth, and
    `check_tapers` says so -- correctly, because a lane that opens in 20 m at 80 km/h is not a
    deceleration lane. (The pair AT the mouth is exempt -- a departing lane is not a merging one,
    8f.4 -- but the pair before it is not, and that is the one that reports.)

    So the slot is opened back along the run to the first station whose OWN next span is long
    enough to hold the taper `point_validate.taper_min_length` asks for. An aux count is an
    integer, so the slot goes from zero to full width across exactly ONE span -- the one between
    the last station that carries it and the first that does not -- and it is that span, not the
    total distance walked, that the gate measures. Opening the slot on more stations does not
    lengthen the taper; it only moves which span the change lands on. The length itself is derived
    from the design speed and the road's own `taper_factor`, the same number `check_tapers`
    measures against, so the gesture and the gate cannot disagree.

    Which way "back" is depends on both the carriageway (FWD travels with increasing index, BWD
    against it) and the job: an exit needs its slot UPSTREAM of the mouth, an entrance downstream.

    an end for the artist is how a road silently grows the wrong way. But the thing the artist was
    actually trying to do -- start a ramp HERE, two thirds of the way along the highway -- had no
    gesture at all. It took `New Road` at a guessed position, a lane count, a role, a one-way
    declaration, an aux slot, `Aux`, `Align Ramp To Aux`, and then a station bent outboard by hand,
    with a red gate at every step in between.

    This is that sequence, in the order it has to happen, with every number that CAN be derived
    derived:

    * the aux slot is opened over the length `check_tapers` asks for (`open_aux_slot`) -- not just
