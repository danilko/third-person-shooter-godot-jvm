"""point_live.py -- the depsgraph dirty set and the debounced rebuild (4.4).

SPLIT IN TWO, AND THAT SPLIT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A trailing-edge debounce does NOT solve the
modal case: a G-drag that pauses for 120 ms fires it, and creating or removing objects while
`transform.translate` is modal fights or crashes the operator -- and there is no clean public "is
a modal operator running" API to gate on.

    during the drag   -- the GPU overlay only (`point_overlay`). A draw handler needs no
                         `bpy.data` write, so it is ALWAYS safe, and the artist sees the ribbon,
                         the lane counts and the link colours follow the point in real time.
    on settle         -- the mesh rebuild, here. `depsgraph_update_post` marks the moved point's
                         road dirty plus any road across a JUNCTION or AUX link; a timer debounce
                         rebuilds only those.

SIX LANDMINES, EVERY ONE OF THEM HANDLED EXPLICITLY -- they are why this file is 200 lines and not
20:

* `depsgraph.updates[i].id` is the EVALUATED datablock. The authored Empty is `.id.original`, and
  the update must be filtered on `is_updated_transform` or every property tweak triggers a sweep.
* Writing into `ROAD_MANAGER_GEN` re-triggers the handler. Guarded by a re-entrancy flag AND by
  ignoring any update whose id lives in GEN -- with only the flag, the debounce never settles.
* `bpy.app.timers` do not survive a file load, and non-`@persistent` handlers are cleared on
  `load_post`. Both are re-armed from a `@persistent load_post`.
* Undo is a memfile snapshot, so `undo_post` re-marks everything dirty rather than trying to
  reason about what changed.
* Rebuilding while a modal operator is live is the crash. Gated on `mode == 'OBJECT'` AND an empty
  `window.modal_operators`.
* `matrix_world` is stale until the depsgraph updates, so a member's world position is never read
  in the same pass that moved its parent -- the read happens in the timer, a tick later.

FULL-NETWORK REBUILD STAYS A BUTTON. This only ever rebuilds the dirty set.
