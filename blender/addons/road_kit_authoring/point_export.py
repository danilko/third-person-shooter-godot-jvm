"""`.lanekit.json` **v2** -- the Godot hand-off.

v1 was a flat list of lanes as dense polylines. Three things were wrong with it and all three are
fixed here by construction rather than by convention:

* **The curve was not a curve.** Every `Curve3D` control point got zero in/out handles, so
  `getBakedPoints()` handed the polyline straight back and cars corner-cut and micro-jittered
  through every bend. Blender ALREADY has the tangents -- the chain is a spline -- so v1 was
  throwing information away, not lacking it. v2 emits `{p, in, out}` per control point, at the
  STATIONS rather than every 4 m sample, which is roughly a 5x drop in control points.
* **"Can a car spawn here" was inferred from whether a turn letter was blank.** That is why all 351
  island through lanes shipped unspawnable. v2 emits an explicit `spawnable` boolean, which cannot
  fail that way.
* **There was no `junctions[]`.** The clique already knows its centre, its arms, their bearings and
  their signal state; emitting it costs nothing here and is exactly what roads-v2 Phase 2's
  `JunctionArbiter` needs -- so the world does not need re-baking when Phase 2 lands.

`points` is still emitted alongside `curve`, so a Godot build that has not taken the v2 reader yet
keeps working unchanged.

THE ONE STRUCTURAL RULE. A road's chain is BROKEN at every junction gap: two chain-adjacent
INTERSECTION points are joined by the pad, not by carriageway, so a lane must not be swept through
the middle of the pad. Each unbroken stretch is a `run`, and runs are joined by turn connectors.

    (an exit -- the aux lane becomes the ramp) or the point they arrive at (an entrance -- the ramp
    becomes the aux lane). That is the whole content of the old `RAMP_EXIT`/`RAMP_ENTRY` split, and
