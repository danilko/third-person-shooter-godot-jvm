"""point_panel.py -- the POINT INSPECTOR (4.2).

A point inspector, NOT a stamping brush. The N-panel edits the active point's own properties
directly, so what you see is what that station is. Junction settings appear when a `JCT_*` parent
is active; the road's base profile when a road collection is.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a scene-level stamp with eleven `use_*` toggles, eight ticked by
default, that silently rewrites the median while you meant to change a lane count. That was the
previous addon's brush and it is the exact failure this file is shaped to avoid. Multi-point
editing still needs a real operator -- Blender's native alt-click propagation does not reach
`CollectionProperty` items and only works within a homogeneous selection showing the same property
-- so `Apply Cross-Section` (in `point_ops`) exists, its source is the ACTIVE point, its mask
defaults to NOTHING, and this panel prints the exact field list before you press it.

INHERIT vs OVERRIDE IS SHOWN, ALWAYS. A whole-profile switch plus four genuine deltas is legible;
a 30-bit invisible mask is not. But if the artist cannot SEE which stations are overrides, they
cannot find where a cross-section changes -- so the mode is the first row of the box and the
overlay glyphs it too.
