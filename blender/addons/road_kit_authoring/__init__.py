# POINT/PORT GRAPH (v0.3) -- see blender/ROAD_POINT_GRAPH.md, the design of record.
#
#     road  = an ordered chain of points (a Collection under ROAD_MANAGER)
#     point = a STATION and a PORT at once: cross-section + typed links (an Empty, `obj.rka_pt`)
#     link  = SEGMENT (symmetric) / JUNCTION (symmetric) / AUX (mainline -> ramp)
#     pad   = a clique over JUNCTION links; the member points ARE the stop lines
#
# Every along-the-length change -- lane drop, lane opening, one-way, an acceleration lane and its
# taper -- is just "two stations that differ", which is what deletes the ~900 lines of special-case
# inference the mesh-graph model needed for the same road.
#
#   point_model    the authored schema + the git-diffable .roads.json; the Empties are a VIEW of it
#   point_profile  station -> lane_profile.Profile; the slot-id vocabulary (F0.., R0.., AF0.., MED)
#   point_solve    chain -> carrier numbers; clique -> pad, fillets, turns; Auto Setback
#   point_edges    the road EDGE: where kerbs open, from the paved footprints
#   point_validate the gate (5) -- a build that fails it is a failed build
#   point_nodes    the Geometry Nodes vocabulary: spine, band, deck, pillars, assets, finish
#   point_build    carrier + stack + pads + ground cut + collision; ROAD_MANAGER_GEN lifetime
#   point_export   .lanekit.json v2 -- real bezier handles, junctions[], explicit `spawnable`
#   point_ops      the authoring gestures
#   point_panel    the point INSPECTOR (deliberately not a stamping brush)
#   point_overlay  the GPU overlay -- what makes hundreds of points legible, and what follows a
#                  drag in real time
#   point_preview  the TRAFFIC FLOW preview -- the same GPU-overlay discipline pointed at the
#                  EXPORTED lane graph rather than the authored one, because the two are not the
#                  same object and only the exported one ships
#   point_live     depsgraph dirty set + debounced rebuild; geometry on SETTLE only
#
# The two models this replaces are archived under `legacy_graph/` (the mesh graph) and were
# deleted (the per-piece generators) -- see `legacy_graph/README.md`. Neither is imported.
# `blender/lib/` is untouched: `lane_profile.py` still owns the cross-section (this addon calls it
# and never re-derives a lateral offset), `intersection_kit.py` owns junction geometry, and the
# district tools under `blender/tools/` still depend on the rest of it.
