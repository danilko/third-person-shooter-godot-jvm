"""point_solve.py -- the resolver. Authored points in, the numbers geometry is built from out.

NOTHING HERE TOUCHES bpy, AND NOTHING DOWNSTREAM OF HERE COMPUTES A LATERAL OFFSET. Those two
rules are the whole point of the module. `point_build` sweeps what this returns; `point_edges`
reads the same band edges; the gate measures them. If a width is wrong it is wrong in one Python
function (ROAD_POINT_GRAPH.md 1.2, defect 1).

Three things are resolved here:

* **A road chain -> a carrier.** Arclength samples (`road_points.resample`), the interpolated
  cross-section at each one (`road_points.profile_at`), and one flat dict of per-sample numbers
  per the attribute registry below. Every band the GN stack sweeps reads its width and its lateral
  offset from that dict and from nothing else.
* **A clique -> a pad.** Each member point IS its arm's stop line (2.2), so the pad is
  `intersection_kit.build_junction_boundary` driven by `Arm.tail_pos` set to the AUTHORED mouth
  position -- not by a hidden setback solve. Plus the corner fillets, the star-shaped test the
  triangle fan depends on, and the turn paths.
* **delta = surface_z - ground_z -> the understructure.** One call into `road_support`, per
  sample, unconditionally (3.3 rule 1: `ground_z` is sampled by Build, never by a button).

WHY THE ATTRIBUTE REGISTRY IS A TABLE AND NOT A BAG OF STRING LITERALS. A Named Attribute node
pointing at a name the carrier does not carry reads 0 and builds a zero-width band -- silently. At
30-odd names that failure mode is indistinguishable from "my change had no effect". So every
attribute is declared once, with its unit and default, `carrier_values()` fills exactly that set,
and `point_build` asserts the mesh carries it (3.1).

    OVERLAPPING and a plain distance reads 3.5 m of "gap" where there is no hole at all. Paving
