"""point_preview.py -- the TRAFFIC FLOW preview: what Godot will actually receive, in the viewport.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything else in this addon shows the artist the AUTHORED graph -- points,
links, lane counts, the swept ribbon. None of that is what ships. What ships is
`.lanekit.json`: a directed lane graph with explicit successors and weights, and the two are not
the same object. A road can be perfectly built, perfectly gate-green, and still export a lane that
nothing can reach -- which is exactly what the demo network did for its whole life. Its exit ramp
had no predecessor at all, so no ambient car ever drove onto it, and there was no way to see that
from inside Blender short of exporting the file and reading it. The only symptom in-game is "the
ramp is always empty", which nobody attributes to authoring.

So this draws THE EXPORT, not the authoring: it runs `point_export.export_network` and renders the
document that comes back.

    lanes         every exported lane centreline, as a directed ribbon with chevrons, coloured by
                  what it IS -- carriageway, junction connector, ramp hand-off, merge
    successors    the `next` edges, drawn tail-to-head, so a chain that does not close is visible
                  as a gap rather than inferred from a JSON diff
    defects       a lane with no successor whose tail is sitting on another lane's head is drawn
                  RED (it should have chained and did not); a lane nothing can reach is drawn
                  MAGENTA; a RAMP nothing can reach is called out by name in the panel
    cars          optional agents that actually walk the graph, choosing successors by the exported
                  `next_weights`. A ramp no car ever enters is the fastest possible read of a
                  missing edge, and a junction where every car turns the same way is the fastest
                  read of a weight that is wrong.

The cars are a SIMULATION OF THE EXPORTED GRAPH and nothing more -- no collision, no following, no
signals. They answer "can traffic get here, and how often", which is the question the authoring
tool can answer; how it drives once it is there is Godot's.

DRAW HANDLERS NEVER WRITE. The agents advance in an `app.timers` tick and the handler only reads
them, the same split `point_live` documents: a draw handler is safe mid-modal precisely because it
touches no `bpy.data`, and that property is what lets the preview keep running while the artist
drags a point.

    Four facts, all of them about REACHABILITY rather than geometry, because geometry already has
    a gate and reachability had nothing:

        broken       a lane with no successor whose tail is sitting on the head of a lane going
                     the SAME WAY. The two are touching; the edge was simply never written. This
                     is the one that matters -- a car reaching it is reclaimed as route-finished
                     and vanishes.
        open_end     a lane with no successor that genuinely runs off the edge of the network.
                     Expected, and separated out so it cannot drown the previous line.
        unreached    a lane no successor points at, whose head is on the tail of a lane going the
                     same way -- the mirror of `broken`, and equally a missing edge. A lane whose
                     head touches nothing is a road entering the world and is not listed.
        misjoined    a lane whose declared successor's HEAD is not where this lane's TAIL is.
                     The edge exists and points somewhere else entirely -- which every other line
                     here reads as healthy, because they only ever ask whether an edge exists.
        ramp_orphans every lane on a road classed `ramp` that nothing leads to, listed whether or
                     not it touches anything, because "the ramp is always empty" is the in-game
                     symptom of exactly this and nobody ever attributes it to authoring.

    The direction gate is what makes the first three usable. Reachability is a property of a
    DIRECTED graph, and a report that cannot tell a carriageway's far end from its opposite
    carriageway names every road in the world -- which is a report nobody reads."""
