"""Station -> `lane_profile.Profile`: the slot-id vocabulary, and nothing else.

This module is the ONLY place a road point's scalar fields become a cross-section. It owns the id
vocabulary and it owns chain-wide id STABILITY; it does not own lateral position -- that is
`lane_profile.slot_offset()`, the single owner, and no other module may compute an offset
(redesign defect 1, the one rule that must never be relaxed).

    that the ramp's inboard band edge coincides with THIS value, so `Align Ramp To Aux`, the gate
    that reports the residual and the gore mesh must not each work it out for themselves.

    IT USED TO RETURN THE OUTBOARD EDGE, and that one sign is why a demo exit read as a ramp glued
    to the side of the road. On the outboard edge the ramp is a lane BEYOND the aux lane -- the
    carriageway is three lanes, then a fourth that stays, then a fifth that leaves -- so the aux

    IS the exit lane and the ramp is its continuation: the outermost forward lane at the gore
    becomes the ramp, which is what a parallel-type exit is and what the artist expects to see.

    Case-free on purpose: the anchor is whichever of the slot's two edges is NEARER the standard

    THE BLOCK, NOT ONE SLOT, and that is the correction. With `aux_fwd = 2` the exit is two lanes
    wide and the ramp continues BOTH of them, so its inboard edge belongs on the INNERMOST aux
    slot's inner edge. Anchoring on the outermost slot put a two-lane ramp half on the carriageway

    `direction` NAMES THE CARRIAGEWAY WHEN THE STATION HAS TWO (8l). A station that hands a ramp
    to each carriageway -- one leaving on the forward side, one joining on the reverse side, which
    is the ordinary half-interchange -- declares `aux_fwd` AND `aux_bwd`, and the "most slots, ties
