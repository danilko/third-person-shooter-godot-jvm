"""FULL-PLUGIN COVERAGE: every registered operator driven, every panel drawn, end to end.

    blender --background --python-exit-code 1 \
            --python blender/addons/road_kit_authoring/smoketest_point_coverage.py

The other smoketests each prove one thing about one module. This one proves the ADDON works: that
every button in the sidebar does something, and that the sidebar itself renders.

WHY PANEL DRAWING IS TESTED AT ALL, HEADLESS. `--background` never draws a UI, so a `draw()` method
is the one part of an addon that no headless test touches -- and its failure mode is a typo in a
property name, which raises only when a human opens the sidebar and sees an empty panel with a
console traceback. So the draw methods are RUN here against a recording stub layout, and every
`prop(data, "name")` is resolved against that data's real RNA and every `operator("rka.x")` against
`bpy.ops`. It is not a pixel test; it is the check that the panel refers to things that exist.

WHY EVERY OPERATOR IS DRIVEN. An operator nothing calls is an operator that does not work -- the
previous addon shipped a `Cut Ground Under Road` button that the bake pipeline never called, which
is the confirmed root cause of the mesh-hole reports. A registered operator with no test is the
same bug waiting to happen, so the coverage assertion at the bottom FAILS if a new operator is
added without one here.
