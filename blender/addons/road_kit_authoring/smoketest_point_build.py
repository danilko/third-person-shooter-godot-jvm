"""Step 4's acceptance test: the geometry, headless.

    blender --background --python-exit-code 1 \
            --python blender/addons/road_kit_authoring/smoketest_point_build.py

`--python-exit-code 1` MUST come before `--python`, or a crash in here exits 0 and the test
silently "passes".

Proven against the shapes that killed the previous two models, built deliberately rather than
found on the island: a GORE, a SKEW junction, and a PARALLEL OVERLAP that never converges. Every
assertion is on an invariant -- an area, a containment, a run count -- never on an object name.
