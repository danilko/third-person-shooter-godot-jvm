"""The gate.

`ROAD_KIT_REDESIGN.md` 5a: **a build that fails the connectivity check is a failed build.** So the
gate is written FIRST and wired into Build, not left as an advisory console script that nobody runs.

Two rules shape every check in here:

* **Each failure names the OBJECT to fix**, because the artist fixes objects, not indices. A gate
  that reports "lane 47 of road 3" is a gate that gets ignored.
* **A gate that cannot pass is worse than no gate** (defect 11). Superelevation and sight distance
  are therefore WARN, not ERROR: this is a third-person shooter, ambient cars run a throttle
  governor and cannot perceive banking, and a check that fires on every hand-authored road and gets
  overridden every time is a dead check.

      them, or they are two separate runs sharing a collection. Measuring a taper over that gap
