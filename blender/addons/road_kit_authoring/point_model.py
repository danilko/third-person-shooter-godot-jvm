"""Road point/port graph -- the authored data model.

The one rule that shapes this file: **the authored record is a git-diffable `.roads.json`, and the
Blender Empties are a VIEW of it** (ROAD_POINT_GRAPH.md 1.2c). Both previous road models stored the
authored state exclusively in `.blend` IDProperties, so when the model changed there was nothing to
migrate -- only a binary file to regenerate or abandon. So the schema lives here as plain Python
(`PointData` / `RoadData` / `NetworkData`), the JSON is its serialisation, and the bpy
PropertyGroups at the bottom are a projection that is read on load and written on build.

That split is also why this module imports bpy defensively: everything above the `bpy` guard runs
under plain `python3`, which is what lets `point_profile` and `point_validate` -- the profile
builder and the gate -- be tested with no Blender at all.

    """Rebuild every point's links from its Empty's link rows, resolving targets by OBJECT.

    `owners` is `[(road, obj, point)]` for every authored point in the scene; `reassigned` is the
    set of points `dedupe_uids` just handed a fresh uid.

    WHY THIS CANNOT BE DONE IN `read_point` (8j). A link row holds an Object pointer, and
    `read_point` turns it into a uid by reading `target.rka_pt.uid` -- the uid STORED on the
    target, which after a duplicate is somebody else's. Duplicate a road collection and every
    internal link in the copy resolves to the ORIGINAL's points: the copy is wired into the road it
    was copied from, and the original's own membership is then rewritten out from under it. Only a
    pass that can see all the objects at once can tell those apart, so the resolution happens here,
    after the dedupe, from the object map -- which is the ground truth a pointer already is.

    A link whose target is in no road collection is DROPPED. That is not authored data: a point
    with no collection is invisible to the gate, to Build and to the export, and a link to one
    used to resolve -- by uid -- onto whichever real point happened to share its uid, silently
    re-wiring a live road to a deleted one."""

def read_network(scene=None):
    """Scene -> NetworkData, with uid integrity enforced on the way through.

    The dedupe runs on EVERY read rather than at duplicate time, because there is no duplicate-time
    hook to run it in. `session_uid` orders the entries so `dedupe_uids` can tell which object is
    the newer one; Blender's own `.001` suffixing is the only ordering signal available and it is
    good enough -- a Shift+D clone is always the suffixed name.

    MEMBERSHIP IS BUILT FROM THE OBJECTS, NEVER REMAPPED BY UID (8j). It used to be collected as
    the points were read and then patched with `{old_uid: new_uid}` -- which is only a function
    when uids are unique, and the one moment it runs is the moment they are not. Duplicating a road
    collection put the SAME old uid in two roads, so the remap rewrote BOTH: the copy took the new
    uid and the ORIGINAL's road forgot its own points, which arrived at the gate as
    `point_orphan: <the copy> -- point belongs to no road collection` on five points that were
    plainly sitting in a road collection. Which collection an Empty is in is a fact about the
    Empty, so it is read off the Empty."""
