world_grid.py — shared grid/theme/elevation/naming math for the master world layout AND
every per-district builder (PURE PYTHON, no bpy — same convention as road_network.py, so
this can be imported by a Blender-free checker script too).

Single source of truth so a district piece, built as its own isolated Python invocation,
can compute the SAME seam coordinate, elevation, and cross-district traffic route name
that tools/build_world.py's master layout expects at that grid cell — turning "alignment
by convention" (both files happen to use the same numbers) into "alignment by shared
computation" (both files import the same numbers from here).

Imported by tools/build_world.py, tools/check_seams.py, and every district-aware Blender tool
(session_common.py, open_world_session.py, etc.).
