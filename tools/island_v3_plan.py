"""Tokyo-Bay Island v3 — CITY PLANNING rules, in GAME METRES (X east, Y north, centre origin).

`island_v3_geom.py` is the SHAPE of the island (coast, terrain, water, the authored arterial
and rail centrelines). This module is the PLANNING LAYER on top of it — the rules from
`tokyo-bay-island-v3-cityplanning.md` made computable:

    §0  two density fields (castle distance, station distance)
    §1  block size as a rule (per-quarter spec + jitter + dogleg), not a constant
    §2  the castle gradient — which quarter a point belongs to
    §3  expressway deck Z, interchange ramps, the bridge spiral
    §4  farmland parcel grains
    §5  rail Z profile
    §6  SUPPORT DERIVATION — the one function that decides what goes UNDER a surface

PURE PYTHON, no bpy — same rule as `blender/lib/world_grid.py`. Both the SVG plates and the
Blender builder import it, so "the plates and the blend agree" is shared COMPUTATION, not
shared convention. `python3 tools/island_v3_plan.py` runs the self-tests.

# =============================================================================== §6
# SUPPORT DERIVATION — the uniform rule.
#
# There is no separate "highway system" and "ground road system". There is ONE surface
# system, and what appears UNDERNEATH a surface is DERIVED from a single number: how far
# the finished surface sits above the terrain below it.
#
#     delta = surface_z - ground_z   ->   support kind
#
# That is the whole idea. A road drawn at ground level gets nothing under it; lift the same
# road 2 m and it grows an embankment; lift it to 12 m and the embankment becomes a pier
# line. Nothing about the road piece itself changed — only its height did. Because the rule
# is a pure function of delta, it re-evaluates live while a height is dragged, which is why
# it belongs in Geometry Nodes (see build_island_v3.py) rather than in a one-time bake.
# THE RULES LIVE IN `blender/lib/road_support.py`, not here. This module is the island PLANNER;
# the road BUILDER needs the identical rules, and two copies of "what goes under a surface" is
# defect 1 one level up -- the planner would decide a ramp needs a pier line while the builder drew
# an embankment, with nothing to report the disagreement. Re-exported so this module's own callers
# (`build_island_v3.py`, `island_v3_to_graph.py`, `kit_common.py`) keep importing them from here.

# uses a reversed-Z float depth buffer, so at this world scale a couple of centimetres already
# separates the two surfaces by far more than the buffer can confuse. Lifting a road any further
# does not buy more robustness — it just builds a step into the world:
#
#   * the addon's curb is 0.15 m tall (`curb_height` default). A road lifted 0.5 m would sit
#     0.35 m ABOVE the top of its own curb — the cross-section inverts and the curb disappears
#     under the pavement it is supposed to contain. Same for the 0.15 m sidewalk.
#   * every road edge becomes a 0.5 m ledge that characters climb and vehicles drop off, at every
#     kerb line on the map.
#   * the embankment/pier rule (§6) reads `delta = surface_z - ground_z`, and 0.5 m of blanket
#     lift is already past `AT_GRADE_TOL` — every flat road would start generating embankment.
#
# The REAL fix for pavement fighting ground is not lift at all: cut the ground out from under the
# road (`rka.cut_ground_under_road`), so there are not two surfaces competing in the first place.
# The lift is only insurance for wherever that cut has not been run.

    so they arrive at the arterial as two adjacent connections rather than one. Together those
    give the diamond an entrance and an exit that never share ground.

    THE POSITION IS SEARCHED, NOT STEPPED. It began as a fixed +320 m, then as a choice of
    direction at 320 m -- because a fixed direction dropped `IC_RINKAI_E`'s entry 36 m from
    `IC_YAMATE`'s gore. Choosing only the direction has the same flaw one level down: it asks the
    ring to be the right shape at exactly one distance, and where it is not, `fit_ramp` still
    returns its least-bad candidate rather than nothing. Both of the island's pair interchanges
    were living on that: `IC_CHUO_EN` at a 29 m radius against a 59.1 m tier minimum, and
    `IC_RINKAI_E_EN` fitted straight down the middle of the expressway -- never leaving the
    carriageway, then crossing to its far side 4.5 m past its own gore, which is what welded a
    junction a car-length from the gore and pinched that interchange into a bow-tie.

    So the whole placement is swept, and the candidates are judged by what actually matters about
    a ramp, in order: it must LEAVE the expressway (`leaves_mainline` -- a hard requirement, not a
    preference, because a ramp that overlaps its own mainline is a same-grade crossing), it must
    stand clear of the neighbouring interchanges, it should satisfy radius and grade, and only
    then should it sit near the authored `ENTRY_GORE_ADVANCE`. Preference for the authored
    distance comes LAST on purpose: it is the one term that is a wish rather than a constraint."""

    # NAMED, not silenced. These four cannot reach the 59 m a 45 km/h ramp needs from their
    # authored gore/touchdown pair -- the search tries every parallel run and handle scale and the
    # best curve that neither cusps nor doubles back is still short. That is the authoring
    # decision `fit_ramp` was written to surface: move the touchdown further along its arterial,
    # add a loop ramp, or sign these at ~30-35 km/h. Listing them means a FIFTH ramp regressing
    # still fails.
    #
    # `IC_RINKAI_E` and `IC_RINKAI_W` JOINED THIS LIST ON 2026-08-15, and the reason is worth
    # keeping. They used to report 61.7 m and 74.2 m on parallel runs of 300 m and 320 m -- both
    # of which were U-TURNS. Every windowed radius measure available here is blind to a hairpin
    # (see `turns_back`), so the search happily bought its "radius" by folding the ramp back on
    # itself, and the number it reported was real arithmetic on a shape no car can drive. With
    # folds rejected, every parallel run collapses to 0 m, because the honest geometry is simply
    # this: a gore and a touchdown ~180 m apart cannot absorb a 12 m descent (200 m at 6%) AND a
    # turn. The distance between the two points is the constraint, and no search can fix that.
    #
    # ALL SIX JOINED ONCE THE DEPARTURE DIRECTION WAS FIXED (2026-08-15). `fit_ramp` used to try
    # both signs of the mainline tangent and keep whichever solved more easily -- so three exits
    # were authored leaving INTO the traffic they exit from (`lane_joints` measured IC_CHUO and
    # IC_PORT at 179 deg against their own mainline lane, IC_YAMATE at 167). Forcing the sign from
    # `INTERCHANGE_SIDE` makes those exits leave the right way, and their real geometry appears:
    # IC_YAMATE 66.4 -> 11.6 m, IC_CHUO 46.6 -> 30.2 m, IC_PORT 47.4 -> 22.4 m. Nothing got worse;
    # the earlier numbers were measured on ramps pointing backwards. (The ENTRY ramps take the
    # OPPOSITE sign -- see `ramps()` -- and once given it, IC_CHUO_EN went 29.0 -> 76.2 m and left
    # this list.)
    #
    # The shape of the authoring decision is now specific: a real exit lands DOWNSTREAM of its
    # gore -- you leave the motorway and arrive further along. These touchdowns sit beside or
    # behind their gores, so a correctly-directed ramp has to turn most of the way round to reach
    # them. Move each touchdown further along its arterial in the direction of mainline travel, or
    # give the interchange a loop ramp, which is the real answer when a surface street is behind
