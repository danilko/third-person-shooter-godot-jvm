# ROUTE_PREFIX namespaces every district-local route name (lane_<piece>__<route>_<n>) so
# recycled districts that emit identical local names (h12_0_E …) stay unique once several
# stream in together — VehicleRoute.findRoute/pickNextRoute search the LIVE scene by name
# and would otherwise resolve into the wrong district. Seam routes bypass the prefix (their
# names are the cross-district contract and already carry the grid coords). The master
# build leaves the prefix unset.
#
# The `_0` empty of every route ALWAYS carries explicit route metas (WorldBaker reads only
# the first empty). `lane_offset=0.0` is load-bearing: emitters bake the keep-left offset
# into marker POSITIONS, but WorldBaker's default is 1.75 — without the explicit 0.0 the
# runtime shifted every lane a second time, collapsing both directions back onto the road
# centreline (the head-on-traffic bug).

    trumpet / merge tail.

    PIER placement is lower-structure aware: a sample whose column would land on a lower
    carriageway — a street cell of `grid.roads` OR any cell in `straddle_cells` (register a lower
    deck/ramp's cells there) — gets an **H-PIER straddling bent** (`hpier`, legs on either side of

    in the lane. That keeps the elevated deck supported everywhere while never sticking a pillar in
    the middle of the road/ramp below (the reported bug). Clear-ground samples get the normal
    tapered column.

    SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the spine is resampled ONCE via rc.densify(seg_len) into `dp`, and the
    road surface, both edge walls, piers, lane nodes AND the `-colonly` collision are ALL derived
    from `dp` — so none of them diverge (the old bug: road swept a smooth NURBS while walls/piers
    chorded the sparse rc.pts -> gap/facet). `seg_len` (default rc.seg_len = 7 m) sets the discrete
    granularity; the swept surface stays smooth regardless.

    A WALLED ramp sweeps the COMBINED cross-section (deck + BOTH parapets, kc.ramp_section_sweep) as
    ONE welded mesh — the wall sits ON the deck edge so road and wall can never gap (the reported
    'major gap' — separate road+barrier sweeps left the deck ending a shy-line short of the wall,
